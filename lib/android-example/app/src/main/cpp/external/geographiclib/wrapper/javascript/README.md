# Calling the GeographicLib C++ library from JavaScript

The geodesic routines in GeographicLib have been implemented in
JavaScript package
[geographiclib-geodesic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geographiclib-geodesic).
For documentation, see

  https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/JavaScript/doc

William Wall <wallw@users.sourceforge.net> has posted a method of
automatically translating the C++ code into JavaScript

  https://sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib/discussion/1026620/thread/f6f6b9ff/

This will let you use other capabilities of GeographicLib in JavaScript.

This is implemented in [OpenSphere
ASM](https://github.com/ngageoint/opensphere-asm).
